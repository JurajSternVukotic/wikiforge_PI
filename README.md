## About

The purpose of WikiForge is to let users create their own custom wikis, be it for internal documentation, business purposes, worldbuilding, or just personal knowledge bases.
However, it is not just a place to store information, but also link, share, and give/recieve feedback on it, while hopefully making connections along the way.
